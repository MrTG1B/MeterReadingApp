# Meter Reading Progressive Web App (PWA)
# ========================================
# Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta
# GitHub: https://github.com/MrTG2004
# 
# Description:
# This Python script sets up a Flask web server for a Progressive Web App (PWA) 
# that helps users store and calculate meter readings. The app calculates the 
# cost based on the unit consumption with a default rate of â‚¹8 per unit. 
# Users can view and compare previous month readings as well.
# 
# Features:
# - Input and store meter readings
# - Calculate cost based on unit consumption
# - Store and view previous readings
# - Offline access through PWA capabilities
# 
# Usage:
# - Run this script: `python server.py`
# - Access the app through the IP address displayed in the terminal
# - Open the IP address in Chrome on your mobile device and add to home screen to install the PWA
