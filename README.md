# Meter Reading Progressive Web App (PWA)

This is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help users store and calculate meter readings. The app calculates the cost based on the unit consumption with a set rate of ₹8 per unit, which can be modified in the `server.py` file. The app also maintains a database of previous month readings.

## Features

- **Meter Reading Input**: Users can input their meter readings and water costs.
- **Cost Calculation**: The app calculates the total cost based on the unit consumption.
- **Data Storage**: The app stores previous meter readings for comparison and reference.
- **Offline Access**: The app can be installed on mobile devices and used offline.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Flask
- Socket

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MrTG2004/MeterReadingApp.git
   cd meter-reading-pwa
   ```

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask json datetime socket
   ```

3. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```

4. **Access the app**:
   Once the server is running, you will see output indicating the IP address where the app is hosted (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000`). Open this IP address in your Chrome browser on your phone.

5. **Install the PWA**:
   - Open the IP address in Chrome on your mobile device.
   - You should see a prompt to "Add to Home Screen". Click it to install the PWA on your phone.
   - Alternatively, open the Chrome menu and select "Add to Home screen".

## Using the App

- **Input Meter Reading**: Enter the current meter reading, water cost, and any advance payment.
- **View Calculations**: The app will display the unit consumption, cost calculations, and store the data.
- **View Previous Readings**: You can search for previous readings by selecting the month and year.

## Customizing the Cost per Unit

The cost per unit is set to ₹8 by default. To change this, edit the following line in `server.py`:

```python
money = unit_consumed * 8
```

Replace `8` with the desired cost per unit.
